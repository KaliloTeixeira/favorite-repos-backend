# FAVORITES REPOS
I build that application as exercise from Rocketseat classes and could learn how to create an API, create Methods (CRUD) and connect with DataBase. Going further, i've decide to upload that api in heroku. So, you can find it at: https://favorite-repos-backend.herokuapp.com/.

## Technologies
* Node.js - Programming Language
* MongoDB - DataBase

## Libraries
